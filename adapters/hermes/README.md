# NVIDIA NeMo Fabric Hermes Agent Adapter

This adapter runs Hermes Agent through its Python SDK.

## Install

For the complete supported composition, install NeMo Fabric with the Hermes Agent
adapter and Hermes Agent dependencies:

```bash
pip install "nemo-fabric[hermes-agent]"
```

If the host environment already supplies and manages a compatible Hermes Agent,
install the host-managed variant:

```bash
pip install "nemo-fabric[hermes-agent-min]"
```

The `hermes-agent-min` extra still installs the NeMo Fabric runtime and Hermes
Agent adapter, but it does not install Hermes Agent. The host is responsible
for providing a compatible Hermes Agent version.

For host-managed installs, use the dependency constraint declared by this release:
`hermes-agent>=0.17.0; python_version < '3.14'`.

To install the standalone adapter distribution without the root `nemo-fabric`
package:

```bash
pip install nemo-fabric-adapters-hermes
```

The standalone distribution contains only adapter-owned runtime dependencies
and also requires a compatible Hermes Agent installation in the same
environment.

## What It Maps

The adapter receives a normalized payload from NeMo Fabric and materializes a native Hermes Agent configuration for:

- model provider, model name, base URL, temperature, and token settings;
- workspace and terminal settings;
- NeMo Fabric skills as external skill directories for Hermes Agent;
- NeMo Fabric MCP servers as Hermes Agent MCP server config;
- `tools.blocked` as disabled toolsets for Hermes Agent, unioned with
  `harness.settings.disabled_toolsets`;
- optional NeMo Relay telemetry plugin configuration.

`hermes_home` configures a base directory. The adapter creates a child under
`runtimes/<runtime_id>` so invocations in one NeMo Fabric runtime share Hermes Agent state
without sharing config or the session database with another runtime.

## Execution Model

Each NeMo Fabric runtime starts one local adapter host, constructs one Hermes Agent
`AIAgent`, and opens one `SessionDB`. Ordered `Runtime.invoke(...)` calls reuse
those native objects and pass the prior turn's returned transcript back to
`run_conversation(...)`. Runtime stop calls the agent's idempotent `close()`
method, closes the session database, and releases the Relay plugin context when
enabled.

Hermes Agent Relay telemetry is finalized after each NeMo Fabric invocation so its ATOF
and ATIF artifacts are complete when that invocation returns. This telemetry
boundary does not recreate the `AIAgent` or `SessionDB`.

## Maintaining The Adapter

Keep `fabric-adapter.json` aligned with the Python implementation:

- `contract_version` must match the adapter contract supported by NeMo Fabric core.
- `adapter_id` is the stable id selected by `harness.adapter_id`.
- `adapter_kind` is `python` because NeMo Fabric can invoke it through Python.
- `runner.module` names the persistent host module that NeMo Fabric invokes with
  `python -m`.
- `requirements` powers `fabric doctor`; keep required env vars, binaries, or
  packages current.
- `config.accepts` must match the NeMo Fabric sections this adapter maps into Hermes Agent.
- `telemetry.providers` declares provider-specific outputs and integration modes
  the adapter can produce or forward.

Do not put end-user agent settings in this directory. Users vary harness,
model, skills, MCP, tools, telemetry, and runtime behavior through complete
typed `FabricConfig` values and ordinary Python composition. The adapter
descriptor describes adapter capabilities; it is not an agent configuration.
Add descriptor fields only when NeMo Fabric core or the SDK actually uses them.
